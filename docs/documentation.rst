Documentation
=============

To locally generate and preview documentation run the following command in the project root folder:

.. code:: sh

    $ poetry run sphinx-build ./docs ./docs/_build

If the build of the documentation is successful, you can preview the documentation in the docs/_build folder by clicking the ``index.html`` file.
